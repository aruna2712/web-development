<p>A <b>computer</b> is a <span style="color:blue;"> programmable </span>device that stores, retrieves, and processes<span style="color:blue;"> data</span>. The term "computer"was originally given to humans <b>(human computers)</b> who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators, such as the </span style="color:blue;">abacus</span> and</span style="color:blue;"> slide rule</span>. <em>The term was later given to mechanical devices as they began replacing human computers</em>. Today's computers are electronic devices that accept data (<span style="color:blue;">input</span>), <span style=color:blue;">process</span> that data, produce <span style="color:blue;">output</span>, and store (<span style="color:blue;">storage</span>) the results (<span style=color:blue";>IPOS</span>).</p>
<h1>computer overview</h1>
<p>Below is a picture of a computer with each of the main components. Notice the <span style="color:blue;">desktop computer</span>,<span style="color:blue;"> flat-panel display</span>, <span style="color:blue;">speakers</span>, <span style="color:blue;"> keyboard</span>, and <span style="color:blue;"> mouse</span> in the picture below. We've also labeled each of the <span style="color:blue;">input devices</span> and <span style="color:blue;">output devices</span>.</p>

<h1>History of computer</h1>
<p>The <b>first digital computer</b> and what most people think of as a computer was called the<span style="color:blue;"> ENIAC</span> (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). It was built during World War II (1943-1946) and was designed to help automate the calculations being done by human computers. By doing these calculations on a computer, they could achieve results much faster and with fewer errors.

The<i> first generation of computers<i>, such as the ENIAC, used<span style="color:blue;"> vacuum tubes </span>and were often as large as entire rooms. These machines were primarily used by large corporations, universities, or governments. Later, computers began using <span style="color:blue;">transistors</span> and smaller and cheaper parts that allowed the ordinary person to own a computer.
